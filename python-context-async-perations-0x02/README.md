# Context Managers and Asynchronous Programming in Python

## Overview
This script demonstrates the use of context managers and asynchronous programming in Python to interact with a MySQL database. It showcases two key features:
1. **Context Managers** for database connection management.
2. **Asynchronous programming** using `asyncio` and `aiomysql` for concurrent database queries.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `aiomysql` library installed (`pip install aiomysql`)
- Access to a MySQL database with appropriate credentials.

## Installation
1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install aiomysql
